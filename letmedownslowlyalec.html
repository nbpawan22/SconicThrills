        This night is cold in the kingdom<br>
        I can feel you fade away<br>
        From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and<br>
        Your steps keep me awake<br>
        Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste<br>
        I once was a man with dignity and grace<br>
        Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace<br>
        So please, please<br>
        Could you find a way to let me down slowly?<br>
        A little sympathy, I hope you can show me<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile<br>
        As I'm walking down the corridor<br>
        And I know we haven't talked in a while<br>
        So I'm looking for an open door<br>
        Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste<br>
        I once was a man with dignity and grace<br>
        Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace<br>
        So please, please<br>
        Could you find a way to let me down slowly?<br>
        A little sympathy, I hope you can show me<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down<br>
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down<br>
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down<br>
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down<br>
        Could you find a way to let me down slowly?<br>
        A little sympathy, I hope you can show me<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly<br>
        If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br>
